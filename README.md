# Shitty Key Generator

The key generator that only runs commands and doesn't actually generate the keys

Hecho en ðŸ‡µðŸ‡· por RadamÃ©s J. ValentÃ­n Reyes

# Description

The commands that the code automatically runs are the ones listed in [this website](https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/android#signing-the-app) as an attempt to simplify running the commands by prompting the user only for the non-static information and leaving everything else as it is. Automating the process is just meant to speed up the process and remove any error that you may do while rewriting and editing the super long, boring command for key generation.

# Note

Your computer must already have the software required to run the "keytool" command

 # How to use

Just run the shittyKeyGen.exe from this repo if you are on windows or compile the shittyKeyGen.cpp yourself because its open-source
